This Rust program can be built and executed with the following Cargo command:

```cargo run --package parallel-raytracing-rs --bin parallel-raytracing-rs```

It will produce a file in the project root directory called "output.png".

Presently, the image should look like this:

![parallel raytracer output](https://i.imgur.com/aCFNVJ0.png)

A rough draft of a project report is in the root directory as "COP4520 Project Report.pdf".
